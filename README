= JS-Test-san

A JavaScript test runner to run JavaScript tests from the comfort of your
terminal.

== Why?

Because we want to run tests in a real browser environment, in our case WebKit.

And we want to write the tests in a way that we can easily run them on other
browsers as well, you know, html and jsâ€¦

== Example:

This is the output of the current napkin code:

  $ ruby js-test-san.rb test/truncate_test.html

  Running `Truncate Test'
  => running...
  => 3 tests, 8 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors
